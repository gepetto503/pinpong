# _Ping Pong_

#### _Interactive web page that counts up to a certain number, May 5th, 2017_

#### By _**Brendan Hanna**_

## Description

_This interactive web page allows users to input a value and then displays values that count up to that number in increments of one, except that in certain instances (detailed in specs), the value displayed is "ping," "pong" or "pingpong".  It's for people that have an inexplicable fascination with both counting and ping-pong.  ...the word ping-pong, not the game itself._

## Specs

* _1. Take user input and output it on the screen._
  * _example: input = "3"; output = "3"._
* _2. When user inputs another value without refreshing, the current result is replaced by the new one._
  * _example: input = "4", with "3" showing already; output = "4"._
* _3. if user inputs anything other than an integer, the output area says "please enter a number"_
  * _example: input = "a"; output = "please enter a number"._
